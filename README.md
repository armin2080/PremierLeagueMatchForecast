# Premier League Match Forecast
This project aims to predict the outcomes of Premier League matches using historical match data and various statistical features. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast whether a team will win, lose, or draw based on their past performances, opponent statistics, and other relevant factors.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Historical match data is collected from reliable sources and preprocessed for analysis. This includes team performance metrics, match results, and player statistics.

- **Feature Engineering:** The project employs feature engineering techniques to create meaningful input variables for the predictive model. These include rolling averages of key performance indicators such as goals scored (GF), goals conceded (GA), expected goals (xG), possession percentages, shots on target (SOT), and more.
- **Model Development:** Various machine learning algorithms are explored to determine the best approach for predicting match outcomes. The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with an RBF kernel is used as the primary model due to its effectiveness in handling complex relationships within the data.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Model performance is evaluated using cross-validation accuracy, precision scores, and other relevant metrics to ensure robust predictions.
- **Ranking System:** A ranking system is implemented to calculate total points for each team based on predicted results, mimicking real-world football scoring systems.



## Results

The predictive model was evaluated on the test dataset for the 2023 season, achieving the following performance metrics:

- Cross-validation Accuracy: 64%
- Test Accuracy: 64%
- Test Precision: 63%

These metrics indicate that the model is capable of making reasonably accurate predictions regarding match outcomes based on historical data.

## Example Predictions for the 2023 Season
